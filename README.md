Image Server (module for Omeka S)
=================================

> __New versions of this module and support for Omeka S version 3.0 and above
> are available on [GitLab], which seems to respect users and privacy better
> than the previous repository.__


[Image Server] is a module for [Omeka S] that integrates the [IIIF specifications]
and a simple image server (similar to a basic [IIP Image]) to allow to process
and share instantly images of any size and medias (pdf, audio, video, 3D…) in
the desired formats. It works with the module [Iiif Server], that provides main
manifests for items.

The full specifications of the [International Image Interoperability Framework]
standard are supported (versions 2 and 3), so any widget that supports it can
use it.

Rotation, zoom, inside search, etc. may be managed too. Dynamic lists of records
may be created, for example for browse pages.

Images are automatically tiled to the [Deep Zoom], the [Zoomify], the [jpeg 2000]
or the [tiled pyramidal tiff] format. Then they can be displayed directly in any
viewer that support thes formats, or in any viewer that supports the IIIF
protocol. Tiled images are displayed with [OpenSeadragon], the default viewer
integrated in Omeka S.

The [Image Server] supports the IXIF media extension too, so manifests can be
served for any type of file. For non-images files, it is recommended to use a
specific viewer or the [Universal Viewer], a widget that can display books,
images, maps, audio, movies, pdf, 3D, and anything else as long as the
appropriate extension is installed.

The IIIF manifests can be displayed with many viewers, the integrated [OpenSeadragon],
the [Universal Viewer], the advanced [Mirador], or the ligher and themable [Diva],
or any other IIIF compatible viewer.

It supports Amazon S3 backend throught the module [Amazon S3].


Installation
------------

PHP should be installed with the extension `exif` in order to get the size of
images. This is the case for all major distributions and providers.

For [performance reasons], the recommanded image processor is [vips] (command
line tool), but the more common [ImageMagick] (command line `convert`), [GD] or
[Imagick] (php extensions) are supported. Except vips, they are installed by
default in most servers.

The module [Iiif Server] is currently required and should be installed first.

Note: To keep old options from [Universal Viewer], upgrade it to version 3.4.3
before enabling ImageServer. Else, simply set them in the config form.

* From the zip

Download the last release [ImageServer.zip] from the list of releases (the
master does not contain the dependencies), uncompress it in the `modules`
directory, and rename the module folder `ImageServer`.

* From the source and for development:

If the module was installed from the source, check if the name of the folder of
the module is `ImageServer`, go to the root of the module, and run either:

```sh
composer install --no-dev
```

Then install it like any other Omeka module.

* CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)

To be able to share manifests and contents with other Image servers, the server
should allow CORS. The header is automatically set for manifests, but you may
have to allow access for files via the config of the server.

On Apache 2.4, the module "headers" should be enabled:

```sh
a2enmod headers
systemctl restart apache2
```

Then, you have to add the following rules, adapted to your needs, to the file
`.htaccess` at the root of Omeka S or in the main config of the server:

```
# CORS access for some files.
<IfModule mod_headers.c>
    <FilesMatch "\.json$">
        Header add Access-Control-Allow-Origin "*"
        Header add Access-Control-Allow-Headers "origin, x-requested-with, content-type"
        Header add Access-Control-Allow-Methods "GET, POST, OPTIONS"
    </FilesMatch>
</IfModule>
```

It is recommended to use the main config of the server, for example  with the
directive `<Directory>`.

To fix Amazon cors issues, see the [aws documentation].

* Vips

To install [vips], just run `sudo apt install libvips-tools` on Debian/Ubuntu,
or `sudo yum install vips-tools` on Centos/RedHat. Recommanded version is 8.10
or higher. Versions prior to 8.4 have not been tested.

* Jpeg 2000

To support Jpeg 2000, the format should be available with ImageMagick.

* Tiled pyramidal tiff

Tiled pyramidal tiff is supported natively by ImageMagick, but not efficiently
for reading, because it cannot extract a small portion without reading the whole
file. So it is recommended to use the separate library [libvips] for dynamic
extraction.


Image Server
------------

From version 3.6.3.1, tiles are created automatically for all new images, if
option is set. It's not recommended to set it if the existing media doesn't have
tiles yet, so you have to bulk size them first. The conversion of the renderer
from "tile" to the standard "file" can be done with the job in the config form.

Furthermore, an option in settings and site settings allows to specify the
default display: tile or large thumbnail. It can be selected directly in the
theme too (thumbnail "tile").

### Creation of static tiles

If you use vips, the recommended processor strategy is "Auto/Vips" and "tiled tiff".
Else, if jpeg2000 is available, use "Auto/ImageMagick" and "Jpeg 2000". Else,
use "Auto" and Deepzoom.

For big images that are not stored in a versatile format (jpeg 2000 or tiled
tiff) and that cannot be processed dynamically quickly (for example with vips),
it is recommended to pre-tile them to load and zoom them instantly. It can be
done for any size of images. It may be recommended to manage at least the big
images (more than 10 to 50 MB, according to your server and your public.

Tiles can be created in four formats: Deep Zoom and Zoomify creates tile files.
[Deep Zoom Image] is a free proprietary format from Microsoft largely supported,
and [Zoomify] is an old format that was largely supported by proprietary image
softwares and free viewers, like the [OpenLayers Zoom]. They are manageable by
the module [Archive Repertory]. The two other formats, jpeg 2000 and tiled
pyramidal tiff, create only one file that manages tiles internally.

The tiles are created via a background job for any image if the option is set to
manage them automatically. Images can be uploaded from a file, or an url, or
imported.

The media type "Tile", that was a specific type for that, is no more needed,
except in some specific cases. For this media type, the source can be an
uploaded file, a url or a local file (prepended with "file://" in the form, and
requires the module [File Sideload] to be installed). They can be created via
the modules [CSV Import] and [Bulk Import] too.

The tiles can be created in bulk via a job, that can be run via a button in the
config form of the module.

### Dynamic creation of tiles and transformation

The IIIF specifications allow to ask for any region of the original image, at
any size, eventually with a rotation and a specified quality and format. The
image server creates them dynamically from the original image, from the Omeka
thumbnails or from the tiles if any.

This dynamic creation is quick when the original is not too big, or in a tiled
format like tiled pyramidal tiff or jpeg 2000, and when vips is used.

The dynamic creation of tiles can be done with the php extensions GD or Imagick
and with the command line tools ImageMagick, default in Omeka, and vips. GD is
generally a little quicker, but ImageMagick manages many more formats. An option
allows to select the library to use according to your server and your documents
or to let the module chooses automagically. Vips is the largely the quickest in
all cases, and it manages natively common formats (jpeg, png, pdf, tiff).

In case of big files, it is recommended to use vips or the command line version
of ImageMagick, that is not limited by the php memory.

Furthermore, the limit of the size (10000000 bytes by default) can be increased
if you have enough memory, so images won't appear blurry even if they are not
tiled. Vips bypasses this limitation.

### Display of standard and tiled images

When created, the tiles are displayed automatically in admin and theme,
according to the setting in the section Image Server.

Any viewer that supports Deep Zoom or Zoomify can display them directly.
[OpenSeadragon], the viewer integrated by default in Omeka S, can display them
directly (from version 2.2.2), so it is quicker. This is the case for any
derivated viewer too (Universal Viewer, Mirador, etc.). The [OpenLayers] viewer
supports the two formats too.

The options for the default viewer can be changed in the theme (in partial "common/renderer/tile.phtml",
to copy in your theme, or by passing option `template` in the renderer).

When the viewer doesn’t support a format, but the IIIF protocol, the image can
be displayed through its IIIF url (https://example.org/iiif-img/{identifier}).
It can be done for any image, even if it is not tiled, because of the dynamic
transformation of images. OpenSeadragon supports iiif too (v2 and v3).

To display an image with the IIIF protocol, set its url (https://example.org/iiif-img/{identifier}/info.json)
in an attached media of type "IIIF" or use it directly in your viewer. The id is
the one of the media, not the item.

### Routes

All routes of the Image server are defined in `config/module.config.php`.
They follow the recommandations of the [IIIF specifications].

To view the json-ld manifests created for each resources of Omeka S, simply try
these urls (replace :id by a true id):

- https://example.org/iiif-img/:id/info.json for images files;
- https://example.org/iiif-img/:id/:region/:size/:rotation/:quality.:format for
images, for example: https://example.org/iiif-img/1/full/full/270/gray.png;
- https://example.org/ixif-media/:id/info.json for other files;
- https://example.org/ixif-media/:id.:format for the files.

By default, ids are the internal ids of Omeka S, but it is recommended to use
your own single and permanent identifiers that don’t depend on an internal
pointer in a database. The term `Dublin Core Identifier` is designed for that
and a record can have multiple single identifiers. There are many possibilities:
named number like in a library or a museum, isbn for books, or random id like
with ark, noid, doi, etc. They can be displayed in the public url with the
modules [Ark] and/or [Clean Url].

### Amazon S3

Currently, only the public files are available: let the option "expiration" to "0".
You should add CORS header `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` to make OpenSeadragon
and other viewers working. See [aws documentation].

### Vips as default thumbnailer

If you installed vips, you can use it as a [default thumbnailer] for Omeka. The
main interest to use Vips as thumbnailer is not only the performance, but the
possibility to center on the region of interest when cropping the image to get
the square thumbnails. Just set it in the file "config/local.config.php" at the
root of Omeka:

```php
    'thumbnails' => [
        'types' => [
            'square' => [
                'options' => [
                    // Other options: low, centre, high, attention, entropy, depending on version of vips.
                    'gravity' => 'attention',
                ],
            ],
        ],
        'thumbnailer_options' => [
            // Set directory path of "vips" if not in the system path.
            'vips_dir' => null,
        ],
    ],
    'service_manager' => [
        'aliases' => [
            'Omeka\File\Thumbnailer' => 'ImageServer\File\Thumbnailer\Vips',
        ],
    ],
```


TODO / Bugs
-----------

- [ ] Separate from Omeka/Laminas and Convert into a standalone composer package.
- [x] Cache all original images as jpeg2000 to speed up dynamic requests or any region/size.
- [x] Create thumbnails from the tiled image, not from the original (ok for vips).
- [ ] Skip old dynamic tile requests when they are too many, so only the last displayed ones are built.
- [ ] Add a cache mechanism for tiles (doc for server level or in php).
- [ ] Add the iiif tiling (see vips dzsave) and check it for performance.
- [ ] Support curl when allow_url_fopen and allow_url_include are forbidden.
- [ ] Automatically manage pdf as a list of canvas and images (extract size and page number, then manage it by the image server)
- [ ] Remove the specific choice of the processor and use the Omeka one (gd/imagemagick/imagick)
- [ ] Adapt the info.json to the image processor.
- [ ] Add the canonical link header.
- [x] Use the tiled images when available for arbitrary size request (ok for vips/tiled tiff).
- [ ] Update vendor tilers to manage Amazon directly.
- [ ] Add a limit (width/height) for dynamic extraction (used with zoning and annotations).
- [ ] Add a processor for [php-vips].
- [x] Use vips as Omeka thumbnailer.
- [ ] Add auto as default type of tiles (so choose tiled tiff if vips is installed, etc.).
- [ ] Use the library [OpenJpeg] ("libopenjp2-tools" on Debian, or "openjpeg" on Centos instead of ImageMagick for a [performance] reason: ImageMagick always open the file as a whole even when extracting a small part.
- [ ] Fix bitonal with vips.
- [ ] Fix save jp2 with vips/convert.
- [ ] Add an auto choice for thumbnailer (and select it accordiing to input format) and tile type.

This module is a rewrite of the [Universal Viewer plugin for Omeka Classic],
built for the [Bibliothèque patrimoniale] of [Mines ParisTech]. The upgrade to
Omeka S was initially done by [BibLibre]. It has the same features as the
original plugin, but separated into three modules (the IIIF server, the image
server and the widget Universal Viewer). It integrates the tiler [Zoomify] that
was used the plugin [OpenLayers Zoom] for [Omeka Classic] and another tiler to
support the [Deep Zoom Image] tile format.
